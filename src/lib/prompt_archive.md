## **Word Document Structure**  
The generated Word document must be structured as follows:

### **1. Worksheet Section (Main Content)**

     - **6 short-answer questions** (requiring brief explanations, calculations, or analysis).  
     - **4 problem-solving questions** (requiring multi-step solutions and real-world application).  
     - **2 creative thinking questions** (to encourage deeper critical thinking and imagination).  
   - **Number all questions clearly from 1 to 20**.  
   - **Provide enough space for the student to write answers**:
     - Multiple choice: 2 lines  
     - Short answer: 4-5 lines  
     - Problem-solving: 8-10 lines  
     - Creative thinking: 10-12 lines  
   - **Ensure progressive difficulty** (start with simple questions and gradually introduce more challenging ones).  
   - **Use the student's interests (${profile.interests})** to craft relevant and fun scenarios in the questions.  
   - **Include real-world application** to make learning meaningful (e.g., if the student loves soccer, frame math problems around goal statistics).  
   - **Add at least one brain teaser, puzzle, or logic-based challenge** to develop analytical thinking.  
   - **If applicable, describe visuals, diagrams, or hands-on activities** (e.g., "Label the diagram," or "Sketch your answer").  
   - **Ensure all content aligns with the student's US grade-level curriculum.**  

### **ðŸ“Œ Subject-Specific Enhancements**

  - **Ensure questions cover comprehension, critical thinking, grammar, and word usage.**  

### **2. Answer Sheet (Separate Section on a New Page)**  
   - **Leave at least ONE full blank page after the last question** before starting the answer sheet.  
   - **Clearly label the section as 'Answer Sheet'** and ensure it starts on a **new page**.  
   - **Provide complete answers** for all 20 questions.  
   - **Step-by-step explanations** for problem-solving and short-answer questions.  
   - **Break down complex answers into simpler steps** so parents can understand the reasoning.  
   - **For creative thinking questions, include a rubric or key points** that parents can use for evaluation.  
   - **Helpful tips for parents or teachers** on how to explain challenging concepts or encourage the student's problem-solving approach.
